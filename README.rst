IoT Relay-Eagle  -  An Eagle™ Home Energy Gateway plugin for IoT Relay
========================================================================
Release v1.0.1

iotrelay-eagle is a data source plugin for IoT Relay. It polls an
Eagle™ Home Energy Gateway for power readings and forwards those
readings to data handlers connected to IoT Relay. This lets you pull
data from a smart meter and forward it for logging or analysis.

More information about IoT Relay may be found in its
`Documentation <http://iot-relay.readthedocs.org>`_.

iotrelay-eagle uses the `Meter Reader
<https://github.com/eman/meter_reader>`_ library to communicate with
the Eagle™ Home Energy Gateway.

iotrelay-eagle is available on PyPI and can be installed via pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install iotrelay-eagle
